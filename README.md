# Portfolio Analyst

This program provides extra information about the user's stock portfolio by allowing users to enter the ticker symbols for each of the stocks they are holding, and returning up-to-date information on important stock evaluation metrics. This information is then copied to a PDF and formatted in a readable way, before being stored to the user's device.
